          <h3>Robber's Cave</h3>
          <p>Robber's Cave, locally known as Gucchu Pani, is a river cave formed in the Himalayas, about 8 kilometres from Dehradun, Uttarakhand. This river cave is believed to be an abode of Lord Shiva and is very close to Sahasradhara or 'The Thousandfold Springs' in Uttarakhand. Its speciality is that river water flows out from the middle of the cave. The cave is a narrow gorge formed between a conglomerate limestone formation. It creates a feeling similar to being in a scene from a mystery movie - surrounded by dark limestone as streams gush in, echoing inside the cave. If not this, it definitely promises a sense of belongingness as Mother Nature slows you down, making you resonate with its mesmerising beauty.</p>

You pass through these beautiful, ancient villages—Osla, Gangad—and I know it. The tragedy is that trekkers return from Har Ki Dun and do not visit the Ruinsara Valley and the Ruinsara Tal—which are right there. The Ruinsara Valley is even more beautiful than the Har Ki Dun valley. You trek alongside the Ruinsara Gad, a breathtakingly beautiful stream. It's a gradual ascent that won't tax your legs. The landscape keeps changing—the trees, the valley, the sudden opening up of flat grounds around the river. The entire trek is incredibly beautiful. You finally get to Ruinsara Tal, a beautiful alpine lake surrounded by green meadows and snowy hills. The setting itself is magical.</p>
